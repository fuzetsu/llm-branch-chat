# To-do and ideas

## Small

- add scroll box-shadow to indicate where overflow is in scrollable areas (Select, ChatList,
  MessageList, etc)
- move marked/highlighting logic to web worker to not block UI thread

## Bigger

- move away from LocalStorage and use browser based (IndexedDB) or server based (sqlite) DB
- add builtin chat summary functionality (with custom prompts)
- add file/image input support
- add image generation support
